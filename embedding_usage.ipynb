      "Answer:  OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) is a U.S. government agency responsible for safety and health program regulation in most U.S. workplaces. It was established by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, primarily due to a series of major incidents involving high death rates in various industries such as Mining/quarrying, Agriculture, Construction, Transportation/public utilities, Manufacturing, Services, Trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The major incidents that led to the implementation of worker safety included accidents like overexertion, impact accidents, falls, bodily reactions (to chemicals), compression, motor vehicle accidents, exposure to radiation or caustics, rubbing or abrasions, and exposure to extreme temperatures. These accidents often occurred due to factors such as a hectic work environment, pressure to complete tasks on time, and stressors that could cloud judgment and increase the likelihood of an accident.\n",
